### How to contribute?

You can choose to contribute in multiple ways:
- comment and pick up an [issue](https://github.com/danalex97/Speer/issues)
- create a [new issue](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
- mail me on *dan.alex97@yahoo.com* and ask for work
- take a look at the [contributor thread](https://github.com/danalex97/Speer/issues/33)

If you are not sure how you can contribute write onto the [contributor thread](https://github.com/danalex97/Speer/issues/33).

Once you finish the work on an issue, you can create a [pull request](../PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). You can use one of the templates for [bugs](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) or [feature requests](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

#### What to work on?

- check our [roadmap](roadmap.md)

#### Workload

We aim to split the work for the project to be **small over larger periods of times**. We aim for a mean contribution time between **2-3 hours weekly**. We aim for the contributor work onto this project to be recreational rather than stressful.
