A network discrete event **S**imulator for **peer**-to-peer network modeling. **Speer is made for students, researchers and hobbyists.** It's goal is to allow

It combines event-driven simulations with cycle-based concepts and allows parallelization by taking advantage of Goâ€™s concurrency features.
