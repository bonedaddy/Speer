### Motivation and FAQ

**Speer** is a network discrete event Simulator for peer-to-peer network modeling.
It combines event-driven simulations with cycle-based concepts and
allows parallelization by taking advantage of Goâ€™s concurrency features. It aims
to expose clean interfaces which hide the underlying complexity and ensures
correctness via progress and safety properties.

- Why peer-to-peer?

If you quickly google "peer-to-peer networking research" you will probably find
old links. Indeed, [file sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing)
traffic make up only of [3\% of Internet's upstream](https://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-traffic-is-not-dead-its-making-a-comeback-180926/) and
system architectures like [Dynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_DynamoDB)
are less prevalent today. So, why would an open-source project center itself on
a research topic that is rapidly diminishing in popularity since 2008?

**These systems are astonishingly efficient and, arguably, elegant**;
[BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) has been proved to be an
[optimal solution](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1064215) for distributing
data across multiple computers, while DynamoDB being a success project with more
than [100,000 AWS customers](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). Moreover, around
2003, a large number of not so mainstream overlay designs such as Koorde,
Hypercube, Viceroy, Gia or CAN showed interesting and challenging work, but
many of them produced ideas for a very narrow field of applications. We aim to change this!

- For who?

**The goal of Speer is allowing students, researchers and hobbyists to easily
implement, simulate and study peer to peer networks.** This should align with
the goal of making the internet more decentralized and bringing peer to peer
systems to their former glory.

- Why Go?

Go has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing and supports a
large number of concurrent routines. This makes it a good candidate for
implementing a discrete event simulator for a large number of nodes. Moreover,
we take advantage of the ease of running on multiple cores.
